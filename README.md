## Solver for the board game "Gagne ton papa"

### Usage

Edit [`Main.scala`](src/main/scala/Main.scala) to choose the card you want to solve.

You can then run the program to find a solution

```bash
sbt run
# or to find all solution (takes a lot of time, pretty much never ends)
sbt "run --all"
```
